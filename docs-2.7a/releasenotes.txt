Release Notes for CRUX PPC 2.7

  Introduction

   This page discusses the relevant changes introduced in CRUX PPC 2.7a.
   CRUX PPC 2.7  is released  as two  different installation  ISO: 32bit  and
   64bit. The 32bit version  is based on a  single lib toolchain instead  the
   64bit one comes with  a multilib toolchain. These  two versions share  the
   same ports tree.
   Everybody upgrading from the previous release is advised to carefully read
   the following notes.

  Toolchain updates

   CRUX PPC 2.7a includes glibc 2.12.2, gcc 4.5.3 and binutils 2.21.1 .

  Kernel

   Linux-2.6.36.x

  Image

   To save space, all packages shipped with the image are compressed with xz,
   which requires a new version of pkgutils.

  Important changes

   Important libraries have been updated to new major versions, which are not
   ABI compatible with the old versions. We strongly advise against  manually
   updating to CRUX PPC 2.7a via ports, since these changes will  temporarily
   break the system:

     * libgmp has been updated to version 5.0.x, required by gcc and
       coreutils ;
     * libmpfr has been updated to version 3.0.x, required by gcc ;
     * ppl has been updated to version 0.11.x, required by gcc and binutils ;
     * xz has been updated to version 5.0.x, required by libarchive ;
     * openssl has been updated to version 1.0, required by many packages
       (most noticeable: wget, which in turn is called by pkgmk to download
       sources) ;
     * libjpeg has been updated to version 8 ;
     * libpng has been updated to version 1.4 ;
     * cairo is no longer built with support for the glitz backend (this
       affects GTK+ applications and others) ;
     * xulrunner is no longer built with support for dbus and dbus-glib .

    core and opt ports

   CRUX PPC 2.7a ships with Perl 5.12.x . Minor release numbers are no longer
   used in the directory  layout of perl.  It is now  possible to update  the
   perl port without breaking every perl extension module.
   Our glibc does not contain all possible locales, see handbook.
   New features in pkgutils:

     * In addition to gzip, pkgmk has been enhanced to optionally compress
       newly built packages with bzip2 or xz ;
     * pkgutils can read packages that have been compressed with bzip2 and xz
       in addition to gzip ;
     * pkgmk has been extended by the --ignore-new command line switch, which
       makes it ignore new files in a footprint mismatch ;
     * pkgmk has learned distinct exit codes for the various errors that
       might occur.

   acl has been added to core collection.
   btrfs-progs has been added to core collection.
   libattr has been renamed to attr and moved from opt to core collection.
   libpcap and glib have been moved from opt to core collection.
   support for acl/cap has been added to coreutils.
   libmpfr depends on libmpc.
   libmpc has been added to core collection.
   portmap has been removed from core collection.
   NFSv4 support has been added to  nfs-utils. This requires a couple of  new
   libraries (keyutils, libevent, libtirpc, libnfsidmap), and portmap has  to
   be replaced by rpcbind. We have moved  the entire NFS stack to opt,  which
   is still  shipped with  the ISO.  Setup will  handle the  upgrade and  new
   requirements automatically.
   Default configuration of sysklogd has been extended.
   Default logging of dcron is now done via sysklogd.
   gtk depends on gdk-pixbuf.
   mac-fdisk has been moved to 0.13 + gentoo patches.
   libxml2-python and talloc have been added to opt collection.
   links has been replaced by elinks in opt collection for 64bit too.

    xorg ports

   CRUX PPC 2.7a ships with Xorg 7.6 and xorg-server 1.10.x.
   mesa3d depends on libxml2-python and talloc.
   Default X font path has been changed to /usr/share/fonts/X11 .

  Miscellaneous notes

   Please be sure you are using the  latest version of firmware for your  own
   machine.

   When upgrading from CRUX PPC 2.6 to CRUX PPC 2.7a, the setup program  will
   take a while completing the Please wait [2.6 -> 2.7 check] phase.
   CRUX introduced a new boot file: /etc/rc.fix for generic operations to  be
   excuted at boot time. At  the moment the script  takes care of font  cache
   generation for xorg, so your very first boot under CRUX PPC 2.7 will  take
   a few additional seconds.

   ofpath from yaboot  is still unable  to find devices  on Apple's  machines
   using new libata (pata) linux kernel drivers.
   We   recommend    to   read    the   path    devices   directly    through
   /proc/device-tree/aliases/ anyway  are now  present ofpathname  (from  IBM
   powerpc-utils) and  new-ofpath i.e.  the reworked  script by  JoseJX  from
   Gentoo PPC.
   As  suggestion  you  ought  to  use  new-ofpath  for  Apple  machines  and
   ofpathname for IBM machines.

   IBM RS/6000 CHRP  (604e/604ev/604r): the  support for  these machines  has
   been removed from 32bit ISO.

   Acube Sam460ex: the support for these  machines has been added into  32bit
   ISO.

   Genesi Efika users: bootkernel shipped with  CRUX PPC 2.7a has "Root  file
   system on NFS" enabled,  see Efika Install  HowTo. Bootkernel doesn't  use
   Device Tree Supplement  (efika-dts-20071114.zip) because unmaintained  and
   there are some important issues with recent kernels.

   Acube Sam440ep and Sam460ex  users: please, consider  to update u-boot  on
   your board.

  Known issues

   Apple iMac  G5: if  you are  experiencing difficulties  booting, try  with
   "apple64 video=ofonly".
   Genesi PegasosII: Marvell DiscoveryII sram gigabit ethernet  [mv643xx_eth]
   support in kernel > 2.6.31.2 is newly broken.
   Genesi Efika: audio  support in  kernel <  2.6.34 is  unstable. Anyway  to
   enable it you need a reworked Device Tree Supplement forth script.
   IBM pSeries POWER4+  or older:  you could  read some  kernel warning  like
   "ata1: lost interrupt (Status 0x50)".
   Acube Sam460ex: boot from SDHC and audio support aren't yet implemented.

  Tips

   YDL Powerstation  quad  G5 (SLOF):  to  boot  at yaboot  prompt  try  with
   "cdrom:0,/ppc/ppc64/vmlinux root=/dev/sr0" or  "cdrom:0,/ppc/ppc64/vmlinux
   root=/dev/sr0 console=ttyS0,19200".
   IBM Blade, IBM pSeries  POWER5 or newer: choose  a proper working hvc0  or
   hvsi0 console.
   Genesi Efika: choose a proper installation method like via NFS or from USB
   pendrive.
   Acube Sam460ex: onboard  SATA2 controller works  only with LBA48/NCQ  hard
   disk drives .

   As CRUX PPC  2.7a uses new  pata drivers, all  the disks are  now seen  as
   scsi, so what used to be  hda will now be sda,  and the cdrom will be  sr0
   and  if  you  still  experience  any  problems  booting  then  try  adding
   "rootdelay=20" or more.

  Errata
