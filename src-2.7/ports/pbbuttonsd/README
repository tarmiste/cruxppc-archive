pbbuttonsd-0.8

With  Pbbuttonsd 0.8 the format of the configuratione file slightly changed. It uses now the keyfile format 
defined by the freedesktop organisation. It is very similar to the  old  format  which  was  proprietary  to 
pbbuttonsd but is not exactly the same. The main advantage of the new file format is that pbbuttonsd can now 
use code of the glib to pare it, instead doing everything by itself.

the name is changed too:
/etc/pbbuttonsd.conf	<= 0.7.9
/etc/pbbuttonsd.cnf	>=0.8.0
